## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Frist, I try to centering items by [display:relativeï½œabsolute] and Flexbox. It seems like both look fine on different kinds of screen. The key point to use Flexbox is that my codes get cleaner.

Second, I learn that [width/height:100%] and [100vw/vh] are different. When it comes to wider screen, using 100% become a better choice. 

### Continued development

I'm still puzzled by why my background color can't be centered vertically on longer screens, like iPad pro. I will keep on discovering possible solutions.
