### What I learned

Frist, I try to centering items by [display:relativeï½œabsolute] and Flexbox. It seems like both look fine on different kinds of screen. The key point to use Flexbox is that my codes get cleaner.

Second, I learn that [min-height:100vh] is a perfect way to vertically centered my items and extend my background color.
